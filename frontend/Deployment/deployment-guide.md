# Deploying a Full-Stack Typing Application with Google Cloud Platform

This guide explains how we deploy our typing application using Google Cloud Platform's Artifact Registry and Google Kubernetes Engine.

## Architecture Overview

Our application consists of two main components:
- Frontend: React application for the typing interface
- Backend: API server handling user data and authentication

## Deployment Process

### 1. Container Registry Setup

We use Google's Artifact Registry to store our Docker images. Our deployment script handles:
- Building Docker images for both frontend and backend
- Tagging images with the appropriate registry path
- Pushing images to the Artifact Registry

```bash
# Example registry path
${REGION}-docker.pkg.dev/${PROJECT_ID}/${ARTIFACT_REPO}/${IMAGE_NAME}
```

### 2. Deployment Script

We've automated our deployment process using a bash script that:
- Builds Docker images locally
- Tags them appropriately
- Pushes them to Google Cloud Artifact Registry

Key components of our script:
```bash
# Build and tag images
docker build -t "${IMAGE_NAME}" .
docker tag "${IMAGE_NAME}" "${IMAGE_PATH}:latest"

# Push to registry
docker push "${IMAGE_PATH}:latest"
```

### 3. Authentication

Before running the deployment, ensure you:
1. Have gcloud CLI installed
2. Are authenticated with GCP
3. Have Docker configured for Artifact Registry:
```bash
gcloud auth configure-docker "${REGION}-docker.pkg.dev"
```

## Next Steps

After deployment:
1. Configure your Kubernetes cluster
2. Set up load balancers
3. Configure DNS settings
4. Set up SSL certificates

Remember to always test your deployment in a staging environment first!
